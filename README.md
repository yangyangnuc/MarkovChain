# MarkovChain
## Markov Property
Markov property refers to a memoryless stochastic process{X(t),t ∈T}, 
that future states only depend on current states, not on the states preceded it. 
It can be formualted as 
P{Xn=xn|X<sub>0</sub>=x<sub>0</sub>, X<sub>1</sub>=x<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>
=x<sub>2</sub>, ... , X<sub>n-1</sub> = x<sub>n-1</sub>} = P{X<sub>n</sub>=x<sub>n</sub>
|X<sub>n-1</sub> = x<sub>n-1</sub>};

Q1 Process with independent increments {X(t),t≥0}, and X(0) = 0;
Prove that: {X(t),t≥0} is Markov process.
